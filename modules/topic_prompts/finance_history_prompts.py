2. Each panel must show DIFFERENT aspect of the economic concept being explained
3. All panels together must cover the FULL narration

- Economic timeline: Historical scene -> Data/chart visualization -> Modern consequence
- Comparison: Country A economy -> Country B economy -> Contrast/result
- Cause-effect: Policy introduced -> Economic impact -> Long-term outcome

For EACH scene, plan the cartoon illustration using these techniques:
1. artistic_intent: What economic concept or historical event to visualize? What makes it compelling?
2. shot_type: Composition (panoramic cityscape, close-up character, split screen comparison, bird's eye map, data visualization, study room with visual aid)
3. character_action: What is narrator doing? (at desk explaining, walking through historical scene, pointing at chart, observing from distance)
4. mood: Overall feeling (analytical, dramatic, surprising, sobering, triumphant, cautionary, nostalgic)
5. lighting: Warm golden / soft study lamp / dramatic contrast / historical atmosphere
6. color_palette: Dominant colors for this specific scene
7. key_focus: What viewer should notice first (data trend, historical scene, character reaction, map)

VISUAL TECHNIQUES FOR FINANCE/HISTORY:
- PANORAMIC CITYSCAPES showing economic boom or decline (detailed cartoon cities)
- SPLIT SCREEN comparisons (before/after economic policy, country A vs B) - USE for 15-20% of scenes
- DATA VISUALIZATIONS as part of the scene (charts on walls, floating graphs, desk with papers showing numbers)
- MAPS with arrows showing trade flows, economic migration, capital movement
- HISTORICAL SCENES: factories, markets, parliaments, harbors, farms in period-appropriate cartoon style
- NARRATOR AT DESK: historian in warm study, surrounded by books, explaining with visual props
- TIMELINE TRANSITIONS: visual indicators showing passage of decades
- IMPORTANT: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in prompts - use NUMBERS, ARROWS, CURRENCY SYMBOLS, PERCENTAGE SIGNS

COMPOSITION VARIETY REQUIREMENT:
- At least 2-3 scenes MUST use SPLIT SCREEN or panoramic comparison
- At least 2-3 scenes should show DATA VISUALIZATIONS or MAPS

- NEVER request readable text on signs, documents, banners, headlines, labels
- INSTEAD USE: numbers (3.5%, $100M), currency symbols ($, €, kr), arrows (↑↓), flag icons, building icons, percentage signs (%)
- INSTEAD OF text labels, use VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS: a hospital = building with red cross, a school = building with book icon, wealth = gold coins/stacks

CRITICAL ILLUSTRATION STYLE RULES:
- DETAILED cartoon illustration (NOT minimalist - rich, warm, editorial comic style)
- Warm color palette: golden, amber, earth tones, warm blues
- Rich detailed backgrounds with architectural details, furniture, objects
- Characters have DETAILED features (specific face, hair, clothes - NOT round white heads)
- Other people in scenes: detailed cartoon people (NOT silhouettes)
- Show economic data as VISUAL CHARTS, GRAPHS with numbers and arrows (NO text labels)
- Use MAPS with arrows for trade/capital flows
- Historical scenes in period-appropriate cartoon style
- DO NOT write meta-labels like "data visualization:" - just DESCRIBE what the illustration shows

REFERENCE FILE ANNOTATIONS:
- Narrator character MUST have reference file: "warm cartoon historian (nv1.png)"
- Location MUST have reference file: "in warm study room (loc_study.png)"
- Character description from character_lock should be INCLUDED in the prompt
- Format: "[full character_lock description] (nv_xxx.png) [action] in [location description] (loc_xxx.png)"

SCENES TO PROCESS ({batch_size} scenes - create EXACTLY {batch_size} prompts):
{scenes_text}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create EXACTLY {batch_size} scene prompts
2. Each img_prompt MUST be UNIQUE and match the scene's narration
3. Include the FULL character description (from character_lock) in every prompt where character appears
4. Describe data visualizations as ACTUAL OBJECTS in the scene
5. CRITICAL: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in image prompts - use NUMBERS, ARROWS, CURRENCY SYMBOLS, PERCENTAGE SIGNS instead
6. End every prompt with: "detailed cartoon illustration style, warm color palette, soft lighting"

For each scene, create:
1. img_prompt: Detailed illustration prompt describing what the image SHOWS (not meta-instructions). NO TEXT IN IMAGE.
2. video_prompt: Animation description (camera movement, character actions, data animation). MUST end with style: "detailed cartoon animation style, warm color palette, soft lighting"
   - CRITICAL: video_prompt MUST maintain the SAME detailed cartoon animation style as img_prompt
   - Character in video: use FULL character_lock description (detailed features, specific clothes, etc.)
   - Other people in video: detailed cartoon people (NOT silhouettes - rich editorial style)
   - DO NOT create realistic/photorealistic video - keep detailed cartoon animation style
   - Data elements: animated charts, arrows growing, numbers appearing
   - Color palette: golden, amber, earth tones, warm blues

Example img_prompt (GOOD - narrator at desk):
"Warm cozy study room filled with bookshelves and vintage maps on walls, warm cartoon historian with grey wavy hair, round glasses, kind brown eyes, mustard yellow sweater over white collared shirt (nv1.png) sitting at large wooden desk covered with open books and papers, holding up a small cartoon globe, desk lamp casting warm golden light, large window showing twilight sky behind, coffee mug on desk (loc_study.png), detailed cartoon illustration style, warm color palette, soft lighting"

Example img_prompt (GOOD - historical scene):
"Panoramic cartoon illustration of 1890s Stockholm harbor, tall sailing ships and early steamships at wooden docks, warehouse buildings with warm brick facades, workers loading crates of iron ore, large upward-pointing green arrow symbol floating above the harbor indicating economic growth, warm golden sunset lighting, detailed period architecture, cobblestone waterfront (loc_harbor.png), detailed cartoon illustration style, warm color palette, soft lighting"

Example img_prompt (GOOD - data visualization):
"SPLIT SCREEN composition divided by vertical golden line. LEFT SIDE warm amber tones: cartoon illustration of thriving 1950s Swedish factory with smokestacks, workers streaming in, upward green arrow and numbers 4.2% above. RIGHT SIDE cooler tones: same factory in 1990s looking quieter, fewer workers, downward red arrow and numbers 1.1% above, warm cartoon historian with grey wavy hair, round glasses (nv1.png) standing between both sides gesturing at comparison, detailed cartoon illustration style, warm color palette, soft lighting"

BAD examples (DO NOT write like this - has text/words):
- "Chart labeled 'GDP Growth Rate' with text annotations showing 'Sweden leads Europe'"
- "Document with text 'WEALTH CREATION' and 'WELFARE STATE'"
- "Sign reading 'Folkhemmet' on the building"
- "Blueprint with text 'Hem PC Reform'"
- "Banner saying 'FREE HEALTHCARE'"
GOOD versions (visual only, NO words - use icons, flags, numbers):
- "Large cartoon line chart on warm parchment, green line trending upward, Swedish flag icon at top, other country flag icons below, numbers 3.5%, 4.2% next to data points"
- "Two golden scale pans: LEFT pan heavy with factory icons and coin stacks, RIGHT pan lighter with hospital and school building icons, golden arrow pointing from left to right"
- "Warm brick building with Swedish flag on top, family silhouettes visible through windows, golden warm glow emanating from inside"
- "Desktop computer icon on desk with large green checkmark above, Swedish flag pin on the monitor"
- "Hospital building with large red cross symbol on front, green checkmark icon floating above"

Example video_prompt (GOOD - includes full style):
"Warm cozy study room with bookshelves and vintage maps. Cartoon historian with grey wavy hair, round glasses, mustard yellow sweater (nv1.png) sitting at wooden desk, picks up small cartoon globe and rotates it while gesturing knowingly. Desk lamp flickers warm golden light, coffee mug steaming on desk. Camera slowly zooms in on his expression. Detailed cartoon animation style, warm color palette, soft lighting"
