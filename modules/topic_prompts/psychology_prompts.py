ILLUSTRATION TECHNIQUES TO USE:
- VISUAL METAPHORS: abstract concepts shown as physical objects (comparison as a scale, addiction as hooks, chains, walls, masks, etc.)
- CONTRAST SCENES: split screen or before/after showing differences
- DIAGRAMS: brain diagrams, comparison charts, flow visualizations (numbers OK, but NO text/words)
- SILHOUETTE PEOPLE: background/crowd people as simple dark silhouettes
- CHARACTER EXPRESSIONS: exaggerated simple expressions to convey emotion
- IMPORTANT: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in the image - AI generates text with spelling errors. Use ICONS, SYMBOLS, NUMBERS instead

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Create EXACTLY {image_count} illustration scenes - no more, no less
2. Each scene must VISUALLY REPRESENT the narration content
3. Use visual metaphors to illustrate abstract psychology concepts
4. Use EXACT character/location IDs from the lists above
5. scene_id: just use 1, 2, 3...
6. MAIN CHARACTER PRESENCE: The main character should appear in AT LEAST 80% of scenes. Even in conceptual scenes, show the character observing, reacting, or interacting with the visual metaphor. Only omit the character for pure diagram/infographic scenes.
7. REFERENCES ACCURACY:
   - characters_used: ONLY main character or named characters who appear
   - location_used: ONLY ONE location per scene

CHARACTERS (cartoon):
{char_info if char_info else 'Not specified'}

LOCATIONS (cartoon):
{loc_info if loc_info else 'Not specified'}

SCENES TO PLAN:
{scenes_text}

For EACH scene, plan the cartoon illustration using these techniques:
1. artistic_intent: What concept/emotion to convey? What VISUAL METAPHOR to use?
2. shot_type: Composition (centered, split screen, triple panel, close-up, wide, bird's eye)
3. character_action: What is character doing? Expression? What symbolic objects are nearby?
4. mood: Overall feeling (anxious, hopeful, lonely, empowered, reflective, etc.)
5. lighting: Warm soft / dramatic / contrast lighting
6. color_palette: Dominant colors for this specific scene
7. key_focus: What viewer should notice first (visual metaphor, character expression, floating text)

VISUAL TECHNIQUES TO CONSIDER:
- SPLIT SCREEN comparisons (real vs filtered, before vs after, online vs offline) - USE THIS for at least 15-20% of scenes
- TRIPLE PANEL layouts for showing progression or multiple perspectives
- Visual metaphors as PHYSICAL OBJECTS the character interacts with (hooks, scales, chains, masks, walls)
- ICONS and SYMBOLS instead of text (heart icon, question mark, exclamation mark, arrows, etc.)
- Silhouette crowds for "society" or "everyone else"
- Diagrams (brain, comparison charts, timelines) - numbers OK but NO text/words
- Transformation sequences (mask cracking, walls breaking, etc.)
- IMPORTANT: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in prompts - AI generates text with spelling errors

COMPOSITION VARIETY REQUIREMENT:
- At least 2-3 scenes MUST use SPLIT SCREEN or TRIPLE PANEL composition
- At least 2-3 scenes should use CLOSE-UP for emotional impact
- Mix wide, medium, close-up, and multi-panel compositions for visual variety

        return f"""Create detailed CARTOON ILLUSTRATION prompts for these {batch_size} scenes.

IMPORTANT: Each scene becomes a VIDEO CLIP. Prompts must create visuals that MATCH the narration closely.

VISUAL STYLE (MUST follow for ALL scenes):
{context_lock}

CRITICAL ILLUSTRATION STYLE RULES:
- Clean minimalist cartoon illustration with clean black outlines
- Paper texture background
- Main character: use the FULL character_lock description from reference
- Other people: "simple silhouette people" or "simple silhouette figures"
- Show abstract concepts as PHYSICAL OBJECTS the character interacts with (scales, chains, walls, masks, hooks, etc.)
- Use ICONS and SYMBOLS instead of text (heart icon, question mark, exclamation mark, arrows, checkmark, X mark)
- Use split screen for comparison/contrast scenes
- Use diagrams for scientific concepts (numbers OK but NO words)
- NO photorealistic images - everything is minimalist cartoon illustration
- DO NOT write "visual metaphor:" as a label - just DESCRIBE what the illustration shows directly
- CRITICAL: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in the image prompt - AI generates text with spelling errors. Replace text with ICONS, SYMBOLS, or visual representations

REFERENCE FILE ANNOTATIONS:
- Main character MUST have reference file: "cute minimalist character (nv1.png)"
- Location MUST have reference file: "in cozy bedroom (loc_bedroom.png)"
- Character description from character_lock should be INCLUDED in the prompt
- Format: "[full character_lock description] (nv_xxx.png) [action] in [location description] (loc_xxx.png)"

SCENES TO PROCESS ({batch_size} scenes - create EXACTLY {batch_size} prompts):
{scenes_text}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create EXACTLY {batch_size} scene prompts
2. Each img_prompt MUST be UNIQUE and match the scene's narration
3. Include the FULL character description (from character_lock) in every prompt where character appears
4. Describe visual metaphors as ACTUAL OBJECTS in the scene, NOT as meta-instructions
5. CRITICAL: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in image prompts - AI generates text with spelling errors. Use ICONS (heart, question mark, arrows, checkmark, X) and SYMBOLS instead
6. End every prompt with: "clean black outline illustration style, paper texture background"

For each scene, create:
1. img_prompt: Detailed illustration prompt describing what the image SHOWS (not meta-instructions). NO TEXT IN IMAGE.
2. video_prompt: Animation description (character movement, transitions). MUST end with style: "clean minimalist cartoon animation style, paper texture background"
   - CRITICAL: video_prompt MUST maintain the SAME cartoon animation style as img_prompt
   - Character in video: use FULL character_lock description (round white head, simple dot eyes, etc.)
   - Other people in video: "simple silhouette figures"
   - DO NOT create realistic/photorealistic video - keep minimalist cartoon style
   - Visual metaphors remain as PHYSICAL OBJECTS in animation

Example img_prompt (GOOD - no text, uses visual metaphors):
"Restaurant dining table scene, 4-5 simple silhouette people all holding up smartphones taking photos of food on table, cute minimalist character with round white head, small green sprout on top, simple dot eyes, gentle expression, blue t-shirt, beige pants, white sneakers (nv1.png) sitting among them HOLDING CHOPSTICKS actually eating food normally, warm restaurant lighting (loc_restaurant.png), contrast between phone users and real eater, clean black outline illustration style, paper texture background"

BAD example (DO NOT write like this - has text/words):
"visual metaphor: phone as prison bars, floating text label: 'TRAPPED', concept: digital addiction"
GOOD version of the same idea (visual only, no text):
"Character standing behind giant smartphone screen with app icons arranged like PRISON BARS, hands gripping the bars, large exclamation mark icon above, dark blue glow from screen"

Example SPLIT SCREEN prompt (no text, visual contrast only):
"SPLIT SCREEN composition divided by vertical line. LEFT SIDE warm golden tones: cute minimalist character with round white head (nv1.png) sitting at real cafe table, holding warm coffee cup, genuine smile, cozy atmosphere, sun icon above. RIGHT SIDE cold blue tones: same character sitting alone staring at phone screen showing endless scrolling feed, slouched posture, tired eyes, moon icon above, clean black outline illustration style, paper texture background"

Example TRIPLE PANEL prompt (no text, visual progression):
"TRIPLE PANEL horizontal layout. PANEL 1: character wearing decorative social MASK smiling widely, sparkle effects around. PANEL 2: mask starting to CRACK AND PEEL showing real face underneath, crack lines visible. PANEL 3: character with mask fully removed, calm genuine expression, warm golden glow around head, clean black outline illustration style, paper texture background"

Example video_prompt (GOOD - includes full style):
"Cute minimalist character with round white head, small green sprout on top, simple dot eyes, blue t-shirt, beige pants (nv1.png) sitting at restaurant table. Simple silhouette figures around the table simultaneously pull out smartphones and start photographing food. Camera slowly moves toward table. Main character calmly ignores phones, picks up chopsticks and starts eating naturally. Warm soft lighting, clean minimalist cartoon animation style, paper texture background"
