CHARACTERS (Vietnamese cartoon):
{char_info if char_info else 'Not specified'}

LOCATIONS (Vietnamese settings):

SCENES TO PLAN:
{scenes_text}

For EACH scene, plan the cartoon illustration using these techniques:
1. artistic_intent: What economic concept or historical event to visualize? How to make it relatable for Vietnamese viewers?
2. shot_type: Composition (panoramic cityscape, close-up character, split screen comparison, bird's eye map, data visualization, coffee shop with visual aid)
3. character_action: What is narrator doing? (at coffee shop explaining, walking through Vietnamese street, pointing at chart, observing from balcony)
4. mood: Overall feeling (analytical, dramatic, surprising, sobering, triumphant, cautionary, nostalgic)
5. lighting: Warm golden / soft cafe lamp / dramatic contrast / historical atmosphere
6. color_palette: Dominant colors for this specific scene (using Vietnamese earthy tones)
7. key_focus: What viewer should notice first (data trend, historical scene, character reaction, map)

VISUAL TECHNIQUES FOR FINANCE/HISTORY (VIETNAMESE AESTHETIC):
- PANORAMIC CITYSCAPES: Vietnamese cities or foreign cities rendered in Vietnamese illustration style
- SPLIT SCREEN comparisons (before/after, country A vs B) - USE for 15-20% of scenes
- DATA VISUALIZATIONS as part of the scene (charts on walls, floating graphs, desk with papers showing numbers)
- MAPS with arrows showing trade flows, economic movement, capital flows
- HISTORICAL SCENES: factories, markets, harbors in warm Vietnamese illustration style
- NARRATOR AT COFFEE SHOP: Vietnamese historian in cozy cafe, iced Vietnamese coffee, surrounded by books
- VIETNAMESE STREET SCENES: old quarter, motorbikes, street vendors, lanterns, tube houses
- TIMELINE TRANSITIONS: visual indicators showing passage of decades
- IMPORTANT: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in prompts - use NUMBERS, ARROWS, CURRENCY SYMBOLS, PERCENTAGE SIGNS

COMPOSITION VARIETY REQUIREMENT:
- At least 2-3 scenes MUST use SPLIT SCREEN or panoramic comparison
- At least 2-3 scenes should show DATA VISUALIZATIONS or MAPS
- Mix: narrator coffee shop scenes, historical illustrations, city panoramas, data scenes, Vietnamese street scenes

    def step7_scene_prompts(self, context_lock: str, scenes_text: str,
                             batch_size: int) -> str:
        return f"""Create detailed CARTOON ILLUSTRATION prompts with VIETNAMESE AESTHETIC for these {batch_size} scenes.

IMPORTANT: Each scene becomes a VIDEO CLIP. Prompts must create visuals that MATCH the narration closely.

VISUAL STYLE - VIETNAMESE AESTHETIC (MUST follow for ALL scenes):
{context_lock}

ABSOLUTE RULE - NO TEXT IN IMAGES:
- NEVER include ANY English, Vietnamese, or other language WORDS in image prompts
- NEVER use quoted strings like 'WEALTH CREATION', 'GDP GROWTH' etc.
- NEVER request readable text on signs, documents, banners, headlines, labels
- INSTEAD USE: numbers (3.5%, $100M), currency symbols (₫, $, €), arrows (↑↓), flag icons, building icons, percentage signs (%)
- INSTEAD OF text labels, use VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS: a hospital = building with red cross, a school = building with book icon, wealth = gold coins/stacks

CRITICAL ILLUSTRATION STYLE RULES - VIETNAMESE AESTHETIC:
- DETAILED cartoon illustration with Vietnamese cultural identity
- Characters are VIETNAMESE: warm tan skin, dark black hair, dark eyes
- Warm earthy color palette: brick red, golden yellow, jade green, cream white
- Rich detailed backgrounds with Vietnamese architecture (tube houses, French colonial, modern Vietnamese)
- Vietnamese cultural elements: iced coffee (ca phe sua da), conical hats in background, motorbikes, lanterns, tropical plants
- Other people in scenes: detailed cartoon Vietnamese people (NOT Western-looking)
- Show economic data as VISUAL CHARTS, GRAPHS with numbers and arrows (NO text labels)
- Use MAPS with arrows for trade/capital flows
- When depicting OTHER countries: show their settings but maintain Vietnamese illustration style warmth
- DO NOT write meta-labels like "data visualization:" - just DESCRIBE what the illustration shows

REFERENCE FILE ANNOTATIONS:
- Narrator character MUST have reference file: "warm Vietnamese cartoon historian (nv1.png)"
- Location MUST have reference file: "in cozy Vietnamese coffee shop (loc_cafe.png)"
- Character description from character_lock should be INCLUDED in the prompt
- Format: "[full character_lock description] (nv_xxx.png) [action] in [location description] (loc_xxx.png)"

SCENES TO PROCESS ({batch_size} scenes - create EXACTLY {batch_size} prompts):
{scenes_text}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create EXACTLY {batch_size} scene prompts
2. Each img_prompt MUST be UNIQUE and match the scene's narration
3. Include the FULL character description (from character_lock) in every prompt where character appears
4. Describe data visualizations as ACTUAL OBJECTS in the scene
5. CRITICAL: NO TEXT/WORDS/LABELS in image prompts - use NUMBERS, ARROWS, CURRENCY SYMBOLS, PERCENTAGE SIGNS instead
6. End every prompt with: "detailed cartoon illustration style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"

For each scene, create:
1. img_prompt: Detailed illustration prompt describing what the image SHOWS (not meta-instructions). NO TEXT IN IMAGE.
2. video_prompt: Animation description (camera movement, character actions, data animation). MUST end with style: "detailed cartoon animation style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"
   - CRITICAL: video_prompt MUST maintain the SAME detailed cartoon animation style as img_prompt
   - Character in video: use FULL character_lock description (Vietnamese features, specific clothes, etc.)
   - Other people in video: detailed cartoon Vietnamese people (NOT silhouettes)
   - DO NOT create realistic/photorealistic video - keep detailed cartoon animation style
   - Vietnamese setting: motorbikes, tropical plants, French colonial architecture
   - Color palette: brick red, golden, jade green, warm earthy tones

Example img_prompt (GOOD - narrator at Vietnamese coffee shop):
"Cozy Vietnamese coffee shop with wooden tables and green tropical plants, vintage Vietnamese posters on brick walls, warm Vietnamese cartoon historian with short neat dark black hair, thin modern glasses, warm tan skin, light blue polo shirt (nv1.png) sitting at wooden table with Vietnamese iced coffee (ca phe sua da) in tall glass, holding up a small cartoon globe, warm golden light from hanging lanterns, motorbikes visible through open front, ceiling fan slowly turning (loc_cafe.png), detailed cartoon illustration style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"

Example img_prompt (GOOD - Vietnamese historical scene):
"Panoramic cartoon illustration of 1960s Saigon harbor in Vietnamese illustration style, cargo ships at busy docks, French colonial warehouse buildings with warm yellow facades, Vietnamese dock workers in conical hats loading crates, large upward-pointing green arrow symbol floating above the harbor indicating trade growth, warm golden sunset over Saigon River, detailed period Vietnamese architecture, tropical trees lining the waterfront (loc_harbor.png), detailed cartoon illustration style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"

Example img_prompt (GOOD - data visualization Vietnamese style):
"SPLIT SCREEN composition divided by vertical golden bamboo line. LEFT SIDE warm brick red tones: cartoon illustration of thriving Vietnamese factory with workers, motorbikes parked outside, Vietnamese flag, upward green arrow and numbers 7.2% above. RIGHT SIDE cooler jade green tones: same factory in later period looking modernized with new technology, fewer workers, numbers 3.1% above, warm Vietnamese cartoon historian with short dark hair, thin glasses (nv1.png) standing between both sides gesturing at comparison, detailed cartoon illustration style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"

BAD examples (DO NOT write like this - has text/words):
- "Chart labeled 'GDP Growth Rate' with text annotations"
- "Document with text 'DOI MOI REFORM'"
- "Sign reading 'Bank' on the building"
- "Banner saying 'Economic Development'"
GOOD versions (visual only, NO words - use icons, flags, numbers):
- "Large cartoon line chart on warm parchment background, green line trending upward, Vietnamese flag icon at top, other country flag icons below, numbers 7.2%, 3.5% next to data points"
- "Two golden scale pans: LEFT pan heavy with factory icons and dong currency stacks, RIGHT pan lighter with hospital and school building icons, golden arrow pointing from left to right"
- "Modern Vietnamese bank building with Vietnamese flag, golden coin stacks visible through glass windows, green upward arrows"
- "Vietnamese family in modern apartment, laptop on table, large green checkmark above, Vietnamese flag pin on shelf"

Example video_prompt (GOOD - includes full style):
"Cozy Vietnamese coffee shop with tropical plants and hanging lanterns. Vietnamese cartoon historian with short dark hair, thin glasses, light blue polo shirt (nv1.png) sitting at wooden table with iced coffee, picks up small cartoon globe and rotates it while explaining. Ceiling fan slowly turning above, motorbikes passing by outside. Camera slowly zooms in on his expression. Detailed cartoon animation style, Vietnamese aesthetic, warm earthy tones, soft lighting"
