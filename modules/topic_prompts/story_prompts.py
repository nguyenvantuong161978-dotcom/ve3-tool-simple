3. All shots together must cover the FULL narration
4. Use EXACT character/location IDs from the lists above
5. Think cinematically - what sequence of shots tells this story best?

Examples of good splits:
- Character making decision: Close-up face -> Insert object -> Wide shot reaction
- Two people talking: Speaker close-up -> Listener reaction -> Two-shot

- Last segment MUST end at srt_range_end: {total_srt}
- NO gaps between segments (segment N ends where segment N+1 starts)

3. visual_summary: A 2-3 sentence description of what images should show for this segment
4. mood: The emotional tone (tense, warm, sad, hopeful, dramatic, etc.)
5. characters_involved: Which characters appear in this segment

   - location_used: ONLY ONE location per scene (the main setting). Do NOT list multiple locations. If unclear, use the most relevant one
